1)	Open the InvestmentSurveyWork1 PowerBI file first as proof that the raw csv file InvestmentSurvey database was pushed through in Azure Cloud to the final stage of being in a DataMart folder called GoldSpecialized.
a.	InvestmentSurveyWork1 – is a PowerBI file that cannot be used since the Azure Cloud account was closed down.  
b.	Report View (Left-side pane), go to right-side pane (Data), and this shows the table “goldspecialized”.  Click on the downside arrow to see the columns listed in this table.
c.	Click on any one of the columns to create a visual and a notice appears saying that “There are pending changes in your query that haven’t been applied”.  And you are given the option to “Apply Changes” or “Discard Changes”.  
d.	Click on “Apply Changes” and a window pops up saying “Access to the Resource is forbidden”.
e.	This is the (only) proof I have that the raw csv file was pushed through in Azure Cloud to the final stage of being ready to be used for data analysis.
2)	InvestmentSurveycsv Power BI file should be opened next.  This was created from the csv file since I couldn’t work on the ‘transformed’ Azure Cloud file.
a.	The first page “Demographics” contains just that – Demographics, to give the viewer a description of the sample.  Viewer should select each ONE of the two variables to see the differences between the two genders.
b.	The next page “Investments” contains the bar chart visuals for each of the non-demographic variables, and some of these have been transformed into quartiles so that viewers can make more sense of the data.  Use the Gender filter to toggle between Male only and Female only to see the differences between the two genders.
c.	The 3rd page “Investments1) contains the uncategorized visuals of Annual Income, Investment per Month and Years to Save.
Again, use the Gender filter to toggle between Male only and Female only to see the differences between the two genders.
d.	The 4th page “Ah-Ha’s” contain the pie visuals with percentages that demonstrate more clearly than do the bar charts the (sometimes) considerable differences between the two genders in where they invest, how they invest, and how they get their information about investing.
3)	The “Investment Survey” PowerPoint presentation has two parts 
a.	1) Proof that I pushed through the csv file to its final stage in Cloud Azure.
b.	2) Main insights of the survey itself.
